NiftyPy
=========

Registration, segmentation, tomographic reconstruction. 
Python wrapper of NiftyRec, NiftyReg and NiftySeg. 

Typical usage looks like this:

#!/usr/bin/env python
from NiftyPy import NiftyRec


... more documentation is required, for now look at how this package is utilized in occiput.io
While NiftyPy is just a Python wrapper of the NiftyRec, NiftyReg and NiftySeg libraries, occiput.io provides a high level interface for tomographic reconstruction (SPECT, PET, CT) and for other imaging tasks. Itâ€™s easies, with occiput.io, to define the system geometry and reconstruct with iterative algorithms.
